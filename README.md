The Dassun Algorithm is the largest algorithm in Python History and contains 27,000,000 million different integers across 27 sets. The Dassun Algorithm
was designed to test the limitations of Python and the overall ability of Python to analyze and compute an extremely large dataset.

Dassun is NOT a toy! Editing, or use of this code without permission is illegal and Dassun is copyrighted under United States Federal Law as a designated
research project. 

Dassun is an EXTREMELY large program but maintains a relatively small download size. It will crash most texteditors, It is not recommened to run this on 
Low-End Hardware and I am not responsible for any damages caused by this program. It is extremely volitaile and fradgile. 

Dassun must ONLY be run on Windows Command Prompt, Linux Terminal, or Mac Terminal. Any other compiler such as VSCode will not work and will display
incorrect values. Depending on your system hardware, the time for the program to run in Terminal can take from 15 seconds to 15 minutes.
